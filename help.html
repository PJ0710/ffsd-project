        <li><strong>How to make a stock portfolio?</strong><br>If you’re a beginner, here are some steps that you can follow to create your very own stock portfolio. But before you begin, make sure you have a free demat account. Without it, you won’t be able
            to invest in the stock market.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Know what your goals are </strong><br>Before you even begin creating a stock portfolio, it is extremely essential to first identify your goals. This way, you will be in a better position to create one that’s perfect for you. Although your
            ultimate goal is to generate returns, you would have to identify other aspects such as the time frame within which you expect your goals to be satisfied and the amount of money that you’re willing to invest.</li>
        <li><strong>Pick fundamentally good stocks</strong><br> Once you’ve identified your goals, the next step is to start picking the right stocks for your portfolio. When executing this step, make sure to focus on fundamentally strong companies. They’re
            the ones that are stable, less volatile, and more likely to generate stellar returns over the long-term. No matter how attractive a company may look from the outside, if it doesn’t back it up with strong financials and fundamentals, it is
            less likely to do well in the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversify your choices</strong><br> There’s one thing that you should always keep in mind when picking stocks for your portfolio - diversification. Try to select stocks from multiple different sectors and industries. This way, you can
            reduce the risk of your portfolio underperforming during tough times. Concentrating on just one or two sectors increases the chances of your portfolio losing its value during periods of downturn.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Following these three steps diligently can help you create the perfect stock portfolio for yourself.</li>
